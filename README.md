# cargo-devcontainer-template
Simple template to write Rust in a single Cargo library crate in a VSCode devcontainer or a GitHub Codespace.
Includes a minimal set of tools such as the default Rust toolchain and the latest version of Git.

Should build in a typical devcontainer environment or a GitHub Codespace.

Also includes a simple Rust GitHub Actions setup and a Dependabot setup for CI and dependency version checking.

## Using this template

Simple click 'use this template' at the top of the repo page, and you can then create a Codespace on your branch (if you have access), or clone locally in a Devcontainer.
